The notebooks in the `examples` folder are standalone tutorials on how to reconstruct quantum processes with gradient-descent. These notebooks form the basis of the code that generates the data for various plots. The code depends on several open-soruce libraries that need to be installed to run the notebooks. I have also compiled all the code into a python package `gd_qpt` that can be installed in development mode locally (such that any change in the code is instantly reflected). However the example notebooks are sufficient and standalone if you want to explore the method and adapt it for your own use. 

To install gd-qpt locally, clone/download the repository and run the following command from the gd-qpt folder:

```
pip install -e .
```

## Background

In GD-GPT, the quantum process reconstruction problem is framed as a learning task using measurement data from experiments, see below. The Kraus operator representation is chosen for completely positivitity (CP) of the process. The process is kept trace preserving (TP) during optimization with gradient descent using a retraction step that only performs updates on the so called Stiefel manifold keeping the process TP throughout the optimization [2].

The result is a flexible approach similar to the training of neural-networks with backpropagation that can match the performance of state-of-the-art process reconstrction methods such as projected least-squares (PLS) [3] and compressed sensing (CS) [4]. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We demonstrate results for both DV and CV systems. 

Bonus: Neural-network QPT - make a neural network generate the Kraus operators similar to previous works that use neural networks for quantum state tomography. However it seems there is no benefit to using neural networks and constrained gradient-descent with a good enough representation for the process works well.

## How to use the code

There are standalone example notebooks in the folder `examples` that show how to reconstruct processes from simulated data (with Gaussian noise) for both conntinuous- and discrete-variable quantum processes (CV/DV). In the CV case, we go for one of the largest Hilbert-space cutoffs explored (N=32) and reconstruct processes with a few coherent probes and parity measurements. The code builds on several open-source libraries that you can install from pip:

```
numpy
scipy
qutip
jax
cvxpy
dm-haiku
```

All the data for the plots are uploaded in the folder `paper_figures` along with Jupyter notebooks that generate the plots. The data can be re-generated by running the following notebooks specifying the number of qubits, rank of the process and number of Kraus operators as


`python samples.py 2 16 16`

`python measurements.py 2 16 16`

I will document these scripts over time for readability but the example notebook should be sufficient to understand how the code works and reproduce all results independently.

## Continuous-variable QPT example

We use coherent states $|\alpha_i\rangle$ as probes and parity $\Pi(\beta_j)$ as the measurement operators with $\alpha_i, \beta_j$ being complex numbers representing points in the phase-space. Even with a very coarse probe and measurement grid, we get a reasonable reconstruction of the underlying process matrix.
